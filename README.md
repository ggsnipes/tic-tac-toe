# tic-tac-toe

Game project, for General Assembly ANZ.


## Planning process

- Get the basics down and design the webpage
    - Mainly getting the play field correctly set up so that it looks correct
    - Also figure out how to centre the play field
- Look for information on how to design the naughts and crosses via CSS
    - Make it look pretty and also nice to look at versus just a plain letter
    - There needs to be manipulation on how to change between which is active
    - Also interaction with JS
- Look into how to handle player turns and how to use conditional ternary operators (I believe someone used it in one of our warmups)
    - This will handle the player's turn essentially and drop the respective CSS design for the player
    - Need to also chain functions to get the game checking who's turn is it after a click on the div boxes
        - Lots of conditionals, not sure if it'll work but gotta try it once.

## Want to try

- Specifically want to see if I can get a mouseover icon whenever it's someone's turn so they can exactly see which square they are in
    - Unsure how it handles directly but will triple check into it
- Want to hold scores and keep track of who wins
    - Most likely need just class choices and do conversions as with another small project
- Also test LocalStorage with JS
    - Keep users's previous progress on the game so if for some reason internet cuts out, game can still be played.
